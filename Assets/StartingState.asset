  storyText: 'You awaken in a what looks like a dungeon cell.

    You feel the ground rumble as trumpets and cheering echo across the room.

    Sunlight bursts into the room from behind as a rusty portcullis starts to rise.

    You notice the cage has a weak spot, if you''re fast enough, you could possibly
    escape.


    What do you do?

    1. Enter arena - You don''t know what awaits.

    2. Break out - Gotta be sneaky..'
