You awaken in a what looks like a dungeon cell.
You feel the ground rumble as trumpets and cheering echo across the room.
Sunlight bursts into the room from behind as a rusty portcullis starts to rise.
You notice the cage has a weak spot, if you're fast enough, you could possibly escape.

What do you do?
1. Enter arena - You don't know what awaits.
2. Break out - Gotta be sneaky..
